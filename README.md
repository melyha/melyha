# Hi there, I'm Maleeha! 👋

## About Me ✨

I'm a passionate student in the Interactive Design and Technology program at Saskatchewan Polytech with a growing expertise in coding and design. In just a year and a half of coding, I've fallen in love with the problem-solving challenges and continuous learning opportunities this field offers.

While I'm relatively new to coding, I've quickly developed a passion for creating functional and interactive web experiences. I enjoy the challenge of turning design concepts into working code and solving complex problems through programming. My background in graphic design and photography complements my coding skills, allowing me to build solutions that are not only technically sound but also visually appealing and user-friendly. This intersection of technical development and creative design is where I thrive and continue to grow my expertise.
